Working with household data that comes from the third round of the National Family and Health Survey from India. The data was very optimal for running the cutting process of redefining a data frame, and using the plot functions. It was  a lot harder than anticipated to learn how to factor out the levels of the data, get the proper urban type labels on the box plot, and figure out how to use summarise_at. But with three of us putting our heads together we got it sorted out. Really enjoyed investing time into this project, and learning about how to tinker with data in R. Looking forward to learning more, and glad to have pieced together the start of data cleaning in R.
